# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark

#### Author Marina Nikonchuk
#### Final Project for the Module "Computational Thinking with Algorithms" of the H.Dip in Computer Science in Software Development - GMIT

### Project Description
This application benchmarks five different sorting algorithms implemented in Java. The following five well-known sorting algorithms were used:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Merge Sort

_These five sorting algorithms have been chosen according to the following criteria:_

+ A simple comparison-based sort (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort or Insertion Sort)
+ An efficient comparison-based sort (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort)
+ A non-comparison sort (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort)
+ Any other two sorting algorithm of your choice

The Report introducing the detailed analysis of each algorithm and discussing the results of the benchmarking process is also included. 

### Running project
To run the project, users should download the project folder and run the "Runner" in any Java IDE.
